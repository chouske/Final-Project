Non-interactive cinematic: First we have the click to continue scene, we consider this to be our loading screen, then your main menu appears. here we have music playing and our games logo shows up. lastly when the player clicks play, the screns fades to black before continuing.

Interactive cinematic: in our main menu, when the mouse gets close to the logo, it performs a shake effect. also the play button and credits button have a breathing effect. when the player hovers their mouse over these buttons, the buttons change color, from blue to yellow, then back to blue when the mouse is no longer in contact with the buttons.

Choreography in code:in our game our logo for example its shake animation is done by using hand-typed code with a tween.
