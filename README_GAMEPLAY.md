Audio: There is looping main menu background music, and there are sounds when you pickup slugs
Visual: We have many sprites and there is a shader used on the main menu screen to create the tunnel effect\
Motion: Obstacles move, and the player can jump/double jump to get over the obstacles
Progression: The character gains a point score each time they pick up a slug
Prefabs: We have animation information in json files, and we have a json block in our prefab.js to easily set our character's jump gravity and obstacle movement speed
